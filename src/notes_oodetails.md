### 2D Vector Class

1. When an `object` is created as the same name of a `class`, it is called a companian object.
2. You can still have `main` in it.
3. Overall the `Vector2D` class is more Java style.

### Mutable 2D Vector Class

1. More scala style, but harder to read.

### Scala Naming/Symbolic Names

1. The naming in scala can be completely made of operation symbols like `+ - * / % | & ^(XOR) ! < > = ? $ \ :`.
2. Or a normal name followed by `_` + operation symbols.
3. The name need to have some meanings, or it's just a simply bad naming because it could be hard to read.
4. This more flexible naming can make mathematical classes more meaningful.
