# Scala Notes

The lectures come from [Mark Lewis's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85bHg5AipvU&list=PLLMXbkbDbVt8JLumqKj-3BlHmEXPIfR42&index=1)

### Getting started

1. The top level can only have one of the three things:
    * object
    * class
    * tree

2. It would be better to match the object name with filename

3. When something returns no information, use unit. Java uses void and returns actually nothing.
